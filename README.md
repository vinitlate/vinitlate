### 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Vinit — a Business Analytics graduate student passionate about turning raw data into reliable insights and building the systems that make it possible.

💡 My journey started in business and evolved into data — now I’m focused on bridging the gap between **data analysis** and **data engineering**.

---

🛠 **What I do:**
- **Analyze:** Exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, dashboarding  
- **Build:** ETL pipelines, SQL workflows, cloud-native data solutions  
- **Tools I work with:** Python, SQL, Power BI, Alteryx, Databricks, Delta Lake, AWS  

---

🚀 **Currently diving deeper into:**
- Data engineering best practices
- Real-world use cases in agriculture, business, and public data  
- AI/ML foundations for smarter pipelines  

---

✅ What makes me different?  
I’ve worked both upstream and downstream — from cleaning messy source data to building dashboards that drive decisions. I care deeply about making data **accessible, actionable, and scalable**.
